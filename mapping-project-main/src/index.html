<h4>Resources for China Studies</h4>
<p>The China Studies Digital Archives Mapping Project is an ongoing initiative that aims to expand access to primary materials and source collections that are vital to the advancement of the China Studies field. The Mapping Project coordinates researchers, librarians, and database administrators from a range of institutions to enhance access and discoverability for existing repositories and support the development of new digital resources. The directory contains a searchable and downloadable guide to open access databases for China studies research. We provide a list of access partners at leading university libraries to offer walk-in service to researchers without affiliation. This website will be updated frequently. 
</p>
<p>The China Studies Digital Mapping Project is generously supported by the Henry Luce Foundation as an initiative of the Luce/ACLS Program in China Studies. Learn more about the Luce/ACLS Program in China Studies on the ACLS main website.
